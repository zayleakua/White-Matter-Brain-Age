Kua, Tian et al., White Matter Brain Age Gap Independently Mediates Vascular Risk and Cognitive Decline Beyond Grey Matter Age 

Specifically, we propose two distinct approaches for predicting white matter brain age from diffusion MRI data: (1) a region of interest (ROI) based machine learning method and (2) 3D-ResNet Method. The brain-age prediction models are trained on participants from Stage 2 of the cross-sectional, population-based Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) study: www.cam-can.org.

In this study, we hypothesized that the effect of vascular risk factors on cognitive functioning will be mediated by white matter brain age gap (WMBAG), potentially independently of grey matter brain age gap (GMBAG). As processing speed is viewed as a key cognitive resource that underlie the fluent execution of higher-order cognitive processes, we hypothesized that vascular risk burden will first impair information processing speed via WMBAG before deficits appear in fluid intelligence. A secondary aim was to compare different modelling approaches (e.g. machine learning vs. deep learning) in conceptualizing WM brain-age and their associations with vascular health and cognitive outcomes.
